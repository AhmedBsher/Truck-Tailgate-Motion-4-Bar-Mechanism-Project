# Truck Tailgate Motion 4-Bar Mechanism Project #

## Overview

This project involves the design, analysis, and physical prototyping of a 4-bar linkage mechanism intended for a truck tailgate motion system. The project utilizes SolidWorks for CAD modeling, analytical calculations for kinematic analysis, and MATLAB for computational simulation and data processing.

## Project Goals

*   Design a 4-bar linkage mechanism to simulate the motion of a truck tailgate.
*   Perform kinematic analysis (position, velocity, acceleration) using both analytical and computational methods.
*   Develop a 3D CAD model of the mechanism using SolidWorks.
*   Create a physical prototype to validate the design and simulations.

## Project Components

*   **CAD Modeling:** A 3D model of the 4-bar linkage was created using SolidWorks (refer to the project report for details).
*   **Analytical Analysis:** Kinematic analysis was performed analytically to calculate positions, velocities, and accelerations (refer to the handwritten calculations PDF for details).
*   **MATLAB Simulation:** MATLAB was used to simulate the mechanism's motion and generate data for kinematic parameters. The MATLAB code and associated data files are included in this repository.
*   **Physical Prototype:** A physical prototype was constructed to validate the design. (Include photos or videos of the prototype if available)

## Repository Contents

*   `CODE.TXT`, `truck_tilgate_motion.m`: MATLAB code files for simulations.
*   `alpha.csv`, `theta.csv`, `omega.csv`, `12.csv`: CSV data files generated for MATLAB simulations.
